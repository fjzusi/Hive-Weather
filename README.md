## Notes
The biggest issue I'm having right now is that I don't have a clear picture what this website is supposed to do. I want it to provide weather, but I don't know how to present it. Most weather sites have a crazy amount of ways to view weather. I suppose I have access to a few of those. Current conditions, 3 day forecast, 10 day forecast, hourly 1 day forcast, hourly 10 day forecast...ooo there's a 30 day planner feature that lets you pick a time period of no more than 30 days and get predictions of what the weather will be like during that period. and I can get yesterday's weather. It looks like a lot of the page content is taken up with news. I had originally wanted to use CSS animations to make the entire page look like the weather. That'd be useful on mobile screens. Most of them automatically detect the location of the user, which I normally find invasive unless I actually just want to see the weather. It looks like most of them use the same colors and layout too. They're all a shade somewhere between black and blue, all have the title menu bar with the location search, and all have a box with the forecast information in it.
